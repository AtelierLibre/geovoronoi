# geovoronoi â€“ a package to create and plot Voronoi regions in geographic areas

Markus Konrad <markus.konrad@wzb.eu>, Feb./ March 2018


## Limitations

* MultiPolygon shapes of geographic areas are not treated separately when cutting the Voronoi regions (see Sardinia in `random_points_across_italy.py` example)

## TODO

* support of MultiPolygon shapes of geographic areas (see Sardinia in `random_points_across_italy.py` example)
* support for plotting `area_shape` objects with multiple geometries
